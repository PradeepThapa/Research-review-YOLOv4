# Research-review-YOLOv4

## Abstract

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is popular and industry standard framework for object classification and detection in real-time. With the recent development of YOLOv4, it made it more powerful tool. The newer version is faster and accurate for object detection. In YOLOv4, the authors have used new features such as Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN), Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC), Self-adversarial-training (SAT), Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, Cross-Stage-Partial-connections (CSP), CmBN, DropBlock regularization and CIoU loss, and incorporates some of them to reach state-of-the-art results. The study provides evidence that YOLOv4 is faster and more accurate than all available alternative detectors.

In this paper, first I will be briefly introducing YOLO in general and YOLOv4. It is made of up many components so I will be explaining each component of its architecture. The authors have conducted experiments which I will be summarizing and comparing the results with other state of art models and with its own benchmarks. In addition, I have conducted my experiment to test the performance and accuracy. Finally, I will also advocate some of the techniques that can be used to improve accuracy and make it more efficient.
